# HANDOFF — Claude ↔ Codex

Append-only. Newest at the top. Each entry: what changed, what was measured,
what is contested.

## 2026-08-22 — Codex connected as reviewer

Codex CLI 0.149.0 installed, authenticated via ChatGPT, registered as a
project-scoped MCP server (`.mcp.json`) and callable non-interactively with
`codex exec --sandbox read-only "<prompt>"`.

**Open questions where an independent review would be most valuable:**

1. `GLEE_NEGO_SURPLUS_PROBE` (live on Agent 5 + Test 3). Is the randomised
   design sound — assignment seeded on game id, stratified by seat/round-block/
   cap? Is `scripts/analyze_surplus_probe.py` computing P(accept|x) without
   re-introducing selection bias? Is the decision rule (peak of P(accept)*x plus
   continuation) the right objective given percentile scoring?
2. `GLEE_NEGO_FINAL_OPTION` — values our own final take-it-or-leave-it proposal
   as P(accept) x surplus off fitted curves, and refuses to accept below it.
   Arena +0.0004..+0.0012 across two seeds. Is the option value correctly
   specified, and does the buyer branch (pooled `buyer_final` curve) carry the
   same selection problem the response model died of?
3. Persuasion is stuck: no identified defect, play at the 0.548 percentile,
   ratings drifting with the field. Is there a measurement we have not made?
